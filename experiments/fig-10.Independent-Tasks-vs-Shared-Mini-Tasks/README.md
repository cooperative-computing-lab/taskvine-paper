# Taskvine Using MiniTaks to Amortize Transformation Costs of Inputs

This experiment shows how TaskVine can use a minitask to transform an input
(e.g. untar a file) and share the result among tasks running on the same
worker.

The experiment is divided in two. First we will show a smaller run with a local
worker to make sure that everything is working correctly. Then we will show how
to run at scale to reproduce the results in the paper.

## To reproduce the figures in the paper, you can run:  

```sh
source ./activate-environment
./plot_poncho --mode tasks paper_results/a.independent-tasks.transactions independent.pdf
./plot_poncho --mode tasks paper_results/b.shared-minitasks.transactions shared-minitasks.pdf
```

## Small Run

For this experiment you will need two terminals on the same host. In the first
terminal we will execute the manager, and in the second a local worker. In **both**
terminals you will need to activate the conda environment:

```sh
source ./activate-environment
```

If you get an error, please make sure that you executed the `setup-taskvine`
script at the root directory of this repository.


### Shared-Minitasks (Time to run: ~1min)


In the first terminal run:

```sh
source ./activate-environment
python vine_example_poncho.py --mode shared-minitasks --task-count 10
```

After the submission messages, look for a message like this:


```text
TaskVine listening for workers on 9123
```
That will tell you which port to configure the workers. If you get an error such as:

```text
Exception: Could not create manager on port 9123
```

Rerun `vine_run_bgd.py` using the `--port XXXX` option, where `XXXX` is
some available port in your host. Alternatively, you can use `--port 0` to let
the manager pick a free port.


### Executing A Local Worker

In the second terminal start a single worker by running:

```sh
vine_worker -dall --cores 4 -t 900 localhost 9123
```

This creates a local worker with debug information printed to the terminal
(`-dall`), with 4 cores, and connecting to a manager running in the localhost
on port 9123. Replace the port number if you needed to change the default in
the previous step. We also tell the worker to shutdown after 900s (15min) of inactivity.

The log file for this run will be present in `vine-run-info/most-recent/vine-logs/transactions`


### Independent Tasks (Time to run: ~3min)


Now go back to the first terminal and run:

```sh
source ./activate-environment
python vine_example_poncho.py --mode independent --tasks 10
```

This run should pickup the worker from the second terminal if it has not
timed-out. Relaunch the worker if necessary.

The log file for this run will be present in
`vine-run-info/most-recent/vine-logs/transactions`. (The logs of the most
recent run are always linked to `most-recent`.)


## Large Run (between 10 and 20min)

To reproduce the run presented in the paper you will need access to a batch
system that will let you run 50 4-core workers. Each batch job will run a
single worker such as:

```sh
source ./activate-environment

# 4 cores, 12 GB of memory and 12 GB of disk
vine_worker --cores 4 --memory 12000 --disk 12000 IP_OF_MANAGER PORT_OF_MANAGER
```

Alternatively, you can use the catalog server service provided by the
University of Notre Dame, and use:

```sh
source ./activate-environment

# 4 cores, 12 GB of memory and 12 GB of disk
vine_worker --cores 4 --memory 12000 --disk 12000 -M MANAGER_NAME
```

where `MANAGER_NAME` is by default `vine-poncho-$USER`. You can change this name
by running `vine_example_blast.py --name some-other-manager-name`.


We recommend first to run a short example before running with the full 50
workers. For this, simply re-run:

```sh
source ./activate-environment
./vine_example_poncho.py --task-count 10
```

and submit a single worker as appropriate for your batch system.


To execute the complete experiment, run:

```sh
python vine_example_poncho.py --mode share-minitasks --tasks 1000

# and
python vine_example_poncho.py --mode independent --tasks 1000
```


### Example Of Submission File To HTCondor

If your HTCondor does not have special requirements, the generic script
provided may help you to submit the workers required, as:

```sh
source ./activate-environment
# 4 cores, 12 GB of memory and disk
../../utils/condor_vine_workers --cores 4 --memory 12000 --disk 12000 IP_OF_MANAGER PORT_OF_MANAGER 50
```

Or using names:

```sh
# 2 cores, 12 GB of memory and disk
../../utils/condor_vine_workers --cores 4 --memory 12000 --disk 12000 -M MANAGER_NAME 50
```


### Example of submission file for SLURM

For SLURM, check with your system administrators how many cores the compute
node have. For example, for nodes that have 64 cores, you can submit a single
worker as:

```sh
sbatch --job-name vine_worker --ntasks=1 --nodes=1  --cpus-per-task 64 --mem 0 --time 2:00:00 --account=ACCOUNT -- <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
source ./activate-environment
vine_worker --cores 64 -M vine-blast-$USER
EOF
```

Change the time and account arguments as appropriate for your site. To more
closely reproduce the results in the paper you will need to launch as many
workers as to get close to 4x50 = 200 cores. (E.g., with 64-core workers, we
would between 3 and 4 workers).

## Plotting the results

By default, TaskVine writes its execution logs to the directory
`vine-run-info`. The logs of every run are kept in a directory named by the
start time of the manager. The `most-recent` directory is a link to logs of the
manager that executed last.

For plotting we are interested in the transactions log:

```sh
source ./activate-environment
vine_plot_txn_log --mode workers vine-run-info/most-recent/vine-logs/transactions worker.pdf
vine_plot_txn_log --mode tasks   vine-run-info/most-recent/vine-logs/transactions tasks.pdf
```
